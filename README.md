I predefined variables ledpin, buttonpin, blinkspeed (to modify duration of led staying on/off) and buttonstate (HIGH or LOW)

I interpreted the task in 2 ways: (code for both is submitted)

1. blinking of LED and button control (only on/off) are independent of each other- I used switch case to switch between the blinking of LED and using button to 
   turning the LED on/off

2. pressing and holding down the button will lead to blinking of LED-
   a simple if-else statement is used to check if button is pressed or not, and accordingly the led will blink/stay off.
